I worked on YOLOv5 and OpenCV to capture images from the WebCam to train the Yolov5 model on awake and drowsiness. Then build a custom model to check in real time. I could complete training the model to 500 epochs but the final model wasn't working, because of some issue, it said the path to the last.pt or best.pt wasn't correct even though it was. It could be because of very less cache memory, even after using 'force_reload=True' which must clear the cashe before using the custom model, it gave me the same error. Still resolving the issue.
